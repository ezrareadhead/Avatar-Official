Since AI is such a new advancement in technology, I found little resources that helped me use it to build HTML, CSS, and JS code. I’m also very new to this process which meant I faced difficulties that other peers of mine hadn’t, especially in the code generation stages.

The first thing I did was making basic wireframes and inspirational images using Midjourney's AI. I Managed to create 2 images that I liked (Figures 1 & 2)

Unaware of ChatGPT’s character limit, I was finding that the code it produced was being cut off early and following it with “continue” did not solve the problem. This generated code in other languages, with different names, an entirely new structure, and on occasion it ignored the subject entirely (Figure 3). After some discussion, I realised it was only me experiencing this problem and I may have been asking it to produce too big chunks of code at once. 

My second approach was to build a very basic html skeleton using ChatGPT and keep building upon it with more, in depth prompts. This did work better but there were still many inconsistencies within the code as well as duplicate lines. The initial HTML and CSS codes had to be thoroughly edited before the website even worked. Also, I had to familiarise myself with the given code which took much longer than desired. At this point the website looked extremely basic and uninviting (Figures 4 & 5).

After this, I spent time adding media, content, and additional features to build upon the basic site for a more interactive and engaging user experience. I felt significantly overwhelmed at this stage, mostly because the AI had not been as much help to me as I had expected. If anything, I think I was held back by the provided code because of all the time spent editing, overriding, and comprehending it.

My third and final attempt aimed to clean up the code. At this stage I spent the most time removing unnecessary CSS that ChatGPT had provided, to ensure the code was DRY. I also added comments and attempted to regain consistency within the code structure and naming formats.

Personally, I felt that I had to create an entire semantic, responsive, and attractive website within a fraction of the time, and that ChatCPT didn’t speed up this process in the slightest. I am not sure whether this was a universal experience for this project so I will take some accountability for lack of skill and knowledge within this area. I appreciate that this technology is still in development and am optimistic for the future of web design with the help of artificial intelligence, however we are well away from this point. It has been an enlightening experience into the constraints of this technology for future reference. I must admit, this brings me relief that I might have a few years of job security before AI consumes the industry.
